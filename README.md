# BioSync VR

BioSync VR is a virtual reality meditation application that uses a Muse EEG headset to capture brain signals and affect the weather in two immersive environments. The app is designed to provide a unique, responsive meditation experience that adapts to the user's focus level.

## Features

- Two immersive environments: Beach and Mountain
- Real-time weather changes based on user's focus level
- Integration with Muse EEG headset for brain signal capture
- 5-minute and 10-minute meditation sessions
- Session results display with focus level graph
- Compatible with SteamVR-supported headsets

## Environments

### Beach Scene
- Clear, sunny sky with calm waves when focused
- Increasing wind, rougher waves, and darkening sky with rain as focus decreases

### Mountain Scene
- Snowy mountain environment with bonfire and tent
- Weather changes (e.g., fog, snow intensity) based on focus level
